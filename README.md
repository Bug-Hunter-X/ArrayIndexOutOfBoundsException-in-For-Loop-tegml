# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException Bug in Java
This repository demonstrates a common Java programming error: an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` caused by an incorrect loop condition in array iteration.

The `Bug.java` file contains the erroneous code. The loop iterates one element past the end of the array, leading to the exception.  The `BugSolution.java` file provides a corrected version.

This example highlights the importance of careful array indexing in Java.  Always ensure your loop conditions accurately reflect the valid index range of your array to avoid runtime exceptions.
